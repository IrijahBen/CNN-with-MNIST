# CNN-with-MNIST

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with MNIST Dataset
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition, making it a great starting point for learning about CNNs.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python: You should have Python installed (recommended version 3.6 or later).
TensorFlow: You need to install TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library, which provides tools for working with neural networks.
Jupyter Notebook (optional): You can use Jupyter Notebook for running and experimenting with the provided code.
MNIST Dataset: The MNIST dataset is included in TensorFlow, so you don't need to download it separately.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-mnist.git
